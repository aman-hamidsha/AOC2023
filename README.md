This was my first ever AdventOfCode. I did a lot better than I thought I would, and,
despite spending loads of hours on it, I learnt a lot and I feel like my python skills have
doubled. But most importantly, I had a load of fun. Special thanks to James for setting the private 
leaderboard up and a huge thank you to everyone else who's participated (some of you guys are built different!) 
and a special shoutout to those stuck around until the very end without leaving and thus making the leaderboard (slightly) more competitive.
Happy Holidays folks! <3


I've managed to solve 15 stars worth of problems.
Day 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 parts 1 and 2.
Day 3, 5, 7 part 1.

My aim was to just find the solutions, code is not fully optimized for performance.
