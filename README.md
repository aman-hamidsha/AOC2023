This was my first ever AdventOfCode. I did a lot better than I thought I would,
despite spending a load of hours on it. I learnt a lot and I feel like my python skills have
doubled. But most importantly I had a load of fun, crushing the competition in a private leaderboard!


15 stars worth of problems solved.
Day 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 parts 1 and 2.
Day 3, 5, 7 part 1.

Aim was to just find the solutions, code is not fully optimized for performance.
